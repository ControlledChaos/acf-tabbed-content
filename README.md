# Tabbed Content
An easy to use WordPress plugin to create responsive and accessible tabbed content for posts, pages, and CPT's. Thanks to nico3333fr for his [jquery-accessible-tabs-aria script](https://github.com/nico3333fr/jquery-accessible-tabs-aria).

Requires [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) (not included). Does not rely on `get_field()` so tabs will still display with ACF disabled, though you won't be able to edit them anymore.

## Features
1. Responsive tabs.
1. Nested tabs.
1. Enable tabs on any public post type.
1. Shareable links that with a specific tab (or nested tab) open.
1. Tabbed content can include video embeds, shortcodes, etc.
